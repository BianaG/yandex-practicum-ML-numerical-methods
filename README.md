A compnay for car sales service is developing an app to attract new customers. In that app, you can quickly find out the market value of your car. You have access to historical data: technical specifications, trim versions, and prices. You need to build the model to determine the value.  The company is interested in:  
1. the quality of the prediction 
2. the speed of the prediction 
3. the time required for training

The libraries and modules that were used in this project are as follows:

1. pandas
2. numpy
3. math
4. sidetable

5. matplotlib
6. seaborn

7. sklearn - train_test_split

8. sklearn - mean_squared_error

9. sklearn - LinearRegression
10. sklearn - Lasso
11. sklearn - DecisionTreeRegressor
12. sklearn - RandomForestRegressor

13. sklearn - make_scorer
14. sklearn - GridSearchCV

15. sklearn - KNNImputer
16. sklearn - MinMaxScaler
17. sklearn - OrdinalEncoder

18. lightgbm
19. catboost - CatBoostRegressor

20. warnings
